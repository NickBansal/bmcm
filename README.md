BMCM - webpage

This is my final webpage for BMCM.

Overall I am pleased with this outcome but unfortunately I was not able to include pictures into the page.

I had to rearrange my page and include some spaces where I would later include the pictures.

I used Flexbox throughout this page to make it responsive and CSS media queries to change the layout of the page past certain points

I also used the HTML tables to align all the icons with there respective titles.
